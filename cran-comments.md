# New Package Submission - xgb2sql

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Added single quotes to the word XGBoost as requested by the reviewer. 
And according to other packages on CRAN, word SQL stands for the language, same as R.
So single quotes were not added to the word SQL.

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Revised URL of the CRAN page for a task view in canonical form
* Changed title case
* Added reference citation to Description for the related methods

## Test environments
* local Windows 8 x64, R 3.5.1, R devel
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
